In-progress draft of the first post.

Hello! As a first post of this project blog, we will introduce ourselves just a little bit, as well as describe the project. 

"We" are Arvid and Vanja, two students of the Master's CS programme at UU. We met at the beggining of the programme and realized that we enjoy learning and discussing together, and so work well together. As well as having overlapping interest in CS topics. This is why we decided to look for a project during period 1 of this Autumn semester, under the very liberal Open Course format. 

A brief introduction of us as *Individuals*

I'm Arvid. Computer Science Master's student by day, table tennis and video game player by night. I'm not an expert in anything, but interested in various topics, such as verification, programming languages, semantics, and working with kind people.

I'm Vanja. Fastest biker in town. Expert pen tester.

The project we'll be doing is relating to Behaviour-Oriented Concurrency, and research being done on the projects Verona and Pyrona by the Programming Languages group here at UU. Our specification describes the project formally, so anyone interested is encouraged to read that:
